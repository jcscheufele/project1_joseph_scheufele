Database Systems 2: Project 1
Joseph Scheufele 361589387

Section 1:
I use java 17 for this project and visual studio code for development.
the code will run just like in the example text file:

$ java CS4432_Project1_jcscheufele.java 3

Section 2:
I ran my code following the exact ordering of these test cases and it appears that my code executes correctly in all cases.

Section 3:
I think one area where I had a good insight was to deliniate the content of the files by the '.' character. I created helper functions to make the code a little easier to follow.


PS. I couldn't get the jar to work...
